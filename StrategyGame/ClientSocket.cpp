    /* socket()
     The socket() function returns a new socket, with three parameters.
     
     The first argument is address of the domain of the socket.
     The two possible address domains are the unix, for commen file system sockets, and the internet, for anywhere on the internet.
     AF_UNIX is generally used for the former, and AF_INET generally for the latter.
     
     The second argument is the type of the socket.
     The two possible types are a stream socket where characters are read in a continuous stream, and a diagram socket, which reads in chunks.
     SOCK_STREAM is generally used for the former, and SOCK_DGRAM for the latter.
     
     The third argument is the protocol. It should always be 0 except in unusual circumstances, and then allows the operating system to chose TCP or UDP, based on the socket type. TCP is chosen for stream sockets, and UDP for diagram sockets
     
     The function returns an integer than can be used like a reference to the socket. Failure results in returning -1.
