     * A class representing a button on an interface block.

     * @param window A pointer to the current game window.
     * @param x A GLfloat representing the lower left x coordinate of the button in the current interface, from 0 to 1.
     * @param y A GLfloat representing the lower left y coordinate of the button in the current interface, from 0 to 1.
     * @param width A GLfloat representing the width of the button in the current interface, from 0 to 1.
     * @param height A GLfloat representing the height of the button in the current interface, from 0 to 1.
     * @param interfaceX A GLfloat representing the lower left x coordinate of the current interface, in screen coordinates.
     * @param interfaceY A GLfloat representing the lower left y coordinate of the current interface, in screen coordinates.
     * @param interfaceWidth A GLfloat representing the width of the current interface, in screen coordinates.
     * @param interfaceHeight A GLfloat representing the height of the current interface, in screen coordinates.
     * @param action An std::string representing the action which this button can do. This string is read in Visualizer::processButtons function. This string should only be something that can be read there. 
     * @param text An std::string representing the text to display on the button as its name.
