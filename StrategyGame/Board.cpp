/*
 Terrain Attack Pathing
 LIGHT RANGED:
 If on hill, can shoot into forest and jungle.
 If on plains or water, can only shoot into first layer of forest and jungle
 If on mountain, can shoot into forest and jungle with +1 range but -25% combat strength.
 If in forest and jungle, can only shoot into first layer of forest and jungle
 
 HEAVY RANGED:
 Same as Light Ranged except can shooting through forest and jungle takes less.
 
 LIGHT MELEE vs. GREAT MELEE
 Same.
 
 TERRAIN IGNORING
 Ignores terrain - like telepathic spells and stuff
 
 
 
 Terrain Attack Modifiers:
 
 LIGHT RANGED and HEAVY RANGED:
 No difference in attack damage.
 
 LIGHT MELEE vs. GREAT MELEE
 GreatMelee has combat bonus on hills
 
 TERRAIN IGNORING
 No combat modifier
 
 General Combat Modifiers:
 Half of missing hp % is deducted as a combat debuff.
 Flanking Bonus grants 10% combat bonus per flanking unit.

     * The following sections contain for loop that iterates through the list of board tiles with creatures until it finds the designated one, and it deletes it.
     * It is known that this is incredibly inefficient.
     * However, currently there are not too many board spaces that will have creatures for testing purposes.
     
     Ways to fix this in the future:
     * Make a sort function to get the list sorted in a way that is easy to go through to find the right spot.
     * Use std::optional<Creature> instead of Creature* in Tile.hpp
     std::optional (or std::experimental::optional) may not have come out yet, which is a slight problem.
     There were issues getting it to work on 2013 MacBook Pro in Xcode 7, without much trying
     * Download and add the boost library optional functionality
